Hello Odin!

I believe you will succeed. Just believe in yourself.
Keep coding and put everything into this bootcamp coming up.
If it doesn't work out, you will be fine. There will be a job for you out there.

Go to Australia see what happens with life and embrase it. 
You are still at a great age to go.
